It's easy to get up and running with [web analytics](/web-analytics). All you need to do is [install PostHog](/docs/getting-started/install) and you'll automatically start collecting data based on traffic to your app or website.

Web analytics provides you with a single, simple [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard). But it can still be overwhelming if you don't have a technical background or experience with marketing concepts.

This post provides a gentle guide to web analytics by introducing the following:

- **üí° Concepts:** explanations for common analytics terms
- **üõ†Ô∏è Features:** tools and affordances web analytics provides
- **üìã Use cases:** practical examples of how to use web analytics

## Where do I start?

The best way to get started is to open your web analytics [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/web) and take a look at the data, which is all based on how people interact with your website. Then, we can dive into what the data means and how it can help you.

At a glance, the dashboard gives us access to the following:

- **Visitors, pageviews, and sessions:** How many people are coming to your website? How many pages do they visit? How long do they stay?
- **Paths:** Which pages are they going to?
- **Channels:** Where did they come from?
- **User information:** What devices, browsers, and operating systems are they using?
- **Geographic information:** Where are they located?
- **Retention:** How many people are coming back?
- **Goals:** Are users performing the actions you want them to?

We'll dive into all these below.

## How do I use web analytics?

### Visitors, Pageviews, and Sessions

The first thing you'll see at the top of the web analytics dashboard is a graph of visitor data, which we can use to answer questions like these:

- How many people are online _right now_?
- How many people visited in the last week, month, or any custom time range?
- Is the number of visitors going up or down over a given time period?

> **üí° Concept:** What is the distinction between a visitor and a session?
> - A [**session**](/docs/data/sessions) is a set of events for a single visit to your website. Sessions have a start, a duration, and an end.
> - A **visitor** represents a single person visiting your site. A single visitor can have many sessions as they keep coming back.

> **üõ†Ô∏è Feature:** Working with time intervals. Seeing a single data point isn't very useful unless you have some other data to compare it to.

> **üìã Use case:** If you have a weekly newsletter, you can use this data to figure out the best time to send it to your users based on active traffic.
>
> PostHog has a newsletter called [_Product for Engineers_](https://newsletter.posthog.com), and we can use these graphs to figure out when to send it out.
> - Filtering by the "Last 30 days" and grouping by day shows Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the most active weekdays, whereas Saturday would be the day with the least activity.
> - Filtering by the "Last 7 days" and grouping by hour shows the ideal timing is between 1:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. PST, whereas sending it at midnight would likely be a mistake.

### Paths

Paths show you all the specific pages accessed in your app or website, which can help us answer questions like the following:

- What content is popular and effective?
- What is the bounce rate for a particular page?
- What was the last page they visited before leaving?

Top paths and top entry paths drill down into specific pages on your site to show their views, visitors, bounce rate, and scroll depth. You can click on any of the paths to filter the dashboard for that path.

> **üõ†Ô∏è Feature:** Filtering. All the data on the web analytics dashboard can be adjusted with filters. We've been looking at the data for all visitors, but we can filter by all sorts of fields. Here are some examples:
> - filter where _Path Name_ is equal to `"/pricing"`
> - filter where _Device Type_ is equal to `"Desktop"`
> - filter where _Referrer URL_ contains `"youtube.com"`

> **üìã Use case:** PostHog hosts developer documentation at `/docs`. What if we want to find the most popular docs?
> We can click the **+ Add filter** button and add a filter where `Path Name` contains `"/docs"`.

> **üí° Concept:** What is the bounce rate? Bounce rate is the percentage of users who leave your page immediately after visiting. In other words, a bounce is when someone lands on a given page, but don't interact with it and leaves within 10 seconds. For more information, we also have a tutorial available for [how to calculate bounce rate](/tutorials/bounce-rate).

> **üõ†Ô∏è Feature:** Entry paths, end paths, and outbound clicks.
> - The **entry path** shows stats for the first pageview in the session
> - The **end path** shows stats for the last pageview in the session
> - **Outbound clicks** show which links that users clicked on to leave your site

### Channels

- Where is the traffic coming from?

- Channels
- Referrers
- UTM sources

### User Info

- What information about users can I see? Location? Browser?

### Geographic information
### Retention
### Goals

This post is meant as a gentle introduction to the big picture concepts for web analytics. But there are more features available:

- [Conversion goals](/docs/web-analytics/conversion-goals)
- [Retention](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard#retention)
- [LCP scores](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard#lcp-score)

While web analytics is good for tracking high-level website metrics, Product analytics is good for diving deep into how specific users behave. For more on the distinction between the two, check out our post on [Web vs. product analytics](docs/web-analytics/web-vs-product-analytics).
