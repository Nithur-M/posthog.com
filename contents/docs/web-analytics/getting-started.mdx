It's easy to get up and running with [Web analytics](/web-analytics). All you need to do is [install PostHog](/docs/getting-started/install) and you'll automatically start collecting data based on traffic to your app or website.

Web analytics provides you with a single, simple [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/web). But it can still be overwhelming if you don't have a technical background or experience with marketing concepts.

This post is intended as a gentle introduction to web analytics concepts, with practical examples.

## Where do I start?

Web analytics enables you to gather insights based on how people interact with your app or website.

The best way to get started is to open your web analytics [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/web) and take a look at the data available. Then, we can dive into what the data means and how it can help you.

At a glance, we can see:

- Vistors: How many people are visiting?
- Paths: What pages are they going to?
- Channels: Where did they come from?
- Visitor Info: What devices, browsers, and operating systems are they using?
- Geographic information: Where are they located?
- Retention: How many people are coming back?
- Goals: Are people doing what you want based on your defined goals?

We'll dive into all these below.

## How do I use web analytics?

Consider PostHog as an example. We have:

- a marketing website (`posthog.com`)
- an application (`app.posthog.com`)
- a blog (`posthog.com/blog`)
- docs (`posthog.com/docs`)

We track all of those in a single [project](/docs/settings/organizations-and-projects#projects) (it's literally called "PostHog App + Website").

This gives us a single web analytics dashboard we can use for tracking traffic data.

## What can I use it for?

You can use web analytics to find the answers to all sorts of questions:

- Visitors
  - How many people are online right now?
  - How many people are visiting? How many right now? How many over the last N time period?
- Paths
  - Which content is popular and effective?
  - What pages are they going to?
  - What is the bounce rate?
  - What was the last page they visited before leaving (outbound click)?
- Channels
  - Where is the traffic coming from?
- User Info
  - What information about users can I see? Location? Browser?
