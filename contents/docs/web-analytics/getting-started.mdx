It's easy to get up and running with [Web analytics](/web-analytics). All you need to do is [install PostHog](/docs/getting-started/install) and you're all set to collect data based on traffic to your app or website.

Web analytics provides you with a single, simple [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/web). But it can still be overwhelming if you don't have a technical background or experience with marketing concepts.

This post is a gentle introduction to web analytics concepts, with practical examples.

## What are we looking at?

The core idea of web analytics is that you can gather insights based on how people are interacting with your app or website.

Here at PostHog, we use our web analytics dashboard to track both our app and our website (the project is literally called "PostHog App + Website"). That means we can use it to track data about our marketing website (posthog.com) as well as our application (app.posthog.com). Examples:

- App Features: `https://app.posthog.com/web`
- Marketing: `https://posthog.com/web-analytics`
- Docs: `https://posthog.com/docs/web-analytics`

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to open your web analytics [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/web) and start taking a look at the data available.

- Filtering
- Working with time intervals

## Questions

What questions can we answer with web analytics data?

- How many people are visiting? How many right now? How many over the last N time period?
- What pages are they going to?
- How long do they stay? What is a bounce? What is an outbound click?
- Where is the traffic coming from?
- What information about users can I see? Location? Browser?
- Which content is popular and effective?

## Concepts and terminology

- Distinction between visitors and sessions
- Pageviews
- Referrers
- Conversions
- Bounce rate

## Example

posthog the app + posthog.com the website
filtering for blog posts
