## Values

### 1. Progress is more important than process

We can be a chaotic team, but that's OK because we're also good at getting stuff done. We'll create process when it's helpful, but if it's a choice between doing something good/fast and doing something "properly", we'll choose good/fast.

### 2. Sparking joy is a multidisciplinary job

We're called Words & Pictures, but that's not the whole story. We think in animations, emails, events, songs, videos, vibes, and more. There's no such thing as "just a writer" or "just a designer" here. 
  
### 3. We're not an 'ideas' team

You know the type of 'Ideas' person, who comes up with big ideas and then doesn't do anything with it, or tries to get someone else to do it for them? Yeah, we hate people like that. We ship.

## Responsibilities

- Merch and all related creative work
- Customer-facing communications
- Emails, ads, and other non-content marketing
- Special programs, such as PostHog for Startups
- Partnerships, PR, product launches

## How we work

<p>We work in weekly sprints. You can find what we're working on in the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues">company-internal</PrivateLink> repo, where we put together a planning issue for each sprint.</p>

Like other teams, we plan our goals quarterly. Every goal gets assigned an owner who then puts an issue together outlining some of their ideas and steps towards that goal. These issues go [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/).

When we plan product launches or widescale user messaging activities, we begin by drafting a plan [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/). There's a template for messaging activities if other teams want to request work.
